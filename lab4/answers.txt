Part 1:

Exercise 1:

1.1: 
Informally, it means to search for the string "smutex" in the current directory and return the lines that contain it.

1.2:
sthread.cpp:void smutex_init(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void smutex_destroy(smutex_t *mutex)
sthread.cpp:void smutex_lock(smutex_t *mutex)

Exercise 2:

2.1:
grep "Task" RequestGenerator.cpp

2.2:
grep -r "return" *.h


Exercise 3:

grep -r "smutex.*(.*);" .

Let's first break down the string.

"." means any character (except for a newline character) zero or more times.

"(.*)" means any character (except for a newline character) zero or more times in parentheses.

so "smutex.*(.*);" means "smutex" followed by any character then followed by any characters in parentheses, so it's describing the 
function headers of smutex. 

So the command would return the function headers of smutex within all my files.

Exercise 4:

It opens blkdev.h.

Exercise 5: 

 futex_pi_state is priority inheritance state, it's is used to maintain information about the priority inheritance state of a futex.

It's defined in kernel/futex.c  line 188

Exercise 6: 

3 functions contain proc_sched and task, they are:

proc_sched_autogroup_show_task  in kernel/sched/auto_group.c

proc_sched_set_task             kernel/sched/debug.c

proc_sched_show_task            kernel/sched/debug.c
